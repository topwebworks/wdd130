    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>To answer: How do you convert shoppers into buyers? First, show your expertise in that product field. Present
      easy to understand content and user testimonials. Secondly, target a hungry audience that fits your user vision
      through online campaigns. And finally,
      make it easy and satifying to purchase your product online. I would like to build a site that clearly outlines
      those 3 things. Approach is a series of microsites to gain leads through expertise and support. Later will sell my
      services to leads. Not
      selling anything at this point.

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Online Sellers: 69.4% Male, 30.6% Female. Average ages range from 26-57 (Millinials to GenX). 9.1 Million Online
      Retailers in the world and
      2.5 Million of them are
      in the United States. The sellers can be broken down into three categories commonly known as Branded sellers,
      Traditional sellers, and Virtual Goods sellers. Many sell products on their own website by utilizing an in-house
      solution or a shopping cart platform. The rest will find a Marketplace for multiple sellers to list and sell
      products to be shipped and fulfilled by the Marketplace, the seller, or both. The audience for this site is mainly
      those with existing ecommerce or merchant shops,
      looking for more
      effective reach. </p>

    <p>ONLINE MARKETING SERIES Convert shoppers into buyers? 2023 is projected to yield 6.5 trillion dollars in online
      sales. I will show you how to be a part of that.</p>
    <p>What is a Conversion? Conversion is turning shoppers into buyers. At that point in your website journey, people
      repspond to your call-to-action. Let's find out how.</p>
    <p>Be an Expert Spend time helping others succeed, instead of just trying to sell. Show your visitors you know how
      to sincerely help them. Share your experiences and provide possible solutions for them.</p>

    <p>Target Buyers Create user stories of a range of sample customers... user background, house, work, hobbies,
      friends, as much detail as possible. Look for search keyword trends on Google. Try niche campaigns.</p>

    <p>Easy Buy What is the simplest way for your audience to get what they need? Your action item should be obvious to
      anyone, and just one click away. Purchasing items should be an easy 1-3 step process.</p>

    <p>Buyers be where? So you have an awesome product or service. Now what? The web is based around searching for
      things. You will want to offer valuable content based around targeted keywords you have researched. These keywords
      will be based on an audience you have outlined in user personas and from competitor research. Once you figure out
      you audience then you are halfway there!</p>

    <p>“I have followed Brett's Convert Course for over a year now, and it does work! My bird food shop went from
      hundreds to several thousand customers in just six months.” - Barbra T.</p>

    <p>Who is Brett Snyder? I am a web designer and developer that has been in Marketing since before digital was a
      thing. Over the years doing print advertising, the web evolved and showed a faster way to reach customers. What
      are the site requirements and flows for the best conversion paths? Then off to the races with graybox, designs,
      and prototypes all in Figma. Maybe an HTML prototype to preframe development. Finally, build the site. Throw on a
      heatmap & a/b tests. Sounds fun to me.</p>

    <p>“Brett has helped my online business grow from just an idea I had a couple of years ago. He has been generous
      with his time and has shown me how to be my own boss.” - Franklin D.</p>

    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Two decades of web marketing. I’m Brett Snyder, at 17 did a sketch that ended up in some stores. Spent several
      years working for corporations in
      graphic and web design. And now, making those designs come to life using code. Along the way, taught hundreds of
      kids in Vermont and Arizona to believe in themselves through gymnastics. Teaching those kids taught me helping
      others succeed is a core reason for being alive. Finding ways to reach buyers is just part of the digital journey.
      Finding empathy for your customers is key to
      establishing loyalty. I have learned over the years, that trying to sell someone is not as strong as helping them
      solve an issue.</p>

    <h3>Convert</h3>

    <p>How do we find the buyers? Convienience and value! 1 out of 4 people in the world purchase items online. 2023 is
      projected to yield 6.5 trillion dollars in online sales. Let's dig into the top 3 areas to help you get a piece of
      those sales.</p>

    <p>Be an expert. First, show your expertise in your product or service field. Create Helpful blogs and articles that
      add solutions to help customers solve problems without sounding like a car salesman. Create quality content that
      surrounds your search keyword phrases...more on that below. The web content you post on social media and websites,
      should solve issues and create a better quality of life for your target audience. You want to talk about benefits
      rather than features. Learn empathy for your customers. Include testimonials of real people you have helped. Send
      surveys and ask for feedback so you are addressing their needs. Look for trends in their feedback. Once you show
      your audience, you sincerely can help them, you build loyalty and confidence. Never try to sell. The products you
      do sell should have a simple purchase path of item cart > billing/shipping info > review. One click on the same
      page would be ideal but a purchase path usually includes an account-level shop page.</p>

    <p>Target hungry buyers. Secondly, target an eager audience that fits your user vision through online campaigns.
      Take the time to research your competitors. How can your messaging stand out from theirs? What areas and audience
      is not be addressed by your competitors? Start creating user personas from actual or desired customers, from
      background to daily life. The more detail listed, the more you figure out your campaign messaging. Next visit some
      keyword search research tools, like the Google Keyword Planner. Look for trends and try searching for keyword
      phrases that match your targeted personas. Use those keyword phrases in all your web media from articles to video
      descriptions - anything that has searchable text. You may find niche keyword areas to try campaigns on. Like
      instead of "pet food", try "parakeet breeding tips".</p>

    <p>Make buying easy. And finally, make it easy and satisfying to purchase your product or services online. Free
      shipping is a must. Make sure your prices cover general shipping and life just became easier for both parties.
      Remember, you usually only have a couple of seconds to catch a visitor's attention. Most conversions happen "above
      the fold" or the first screen they see. What top "hero" offer would best grab your targeted audience's attention?
      Low Prices? New Benefit? Free item? Video? Add a "lead form" to create an email list of interested people. Treat
      this list like your family; try to help and only sell when applicable. You can add jump links down your landing
      pages but most people stay at the top. You can have a main product and service website, and landing pages. Try to
      keep links to a minimum so your conversion links are immediately obvious or maybe one click away on the same page.

    <h3>Home</h3>
    <p>
      Home page has 3 benefit boxes that link to the 3 main items on the convert page. The site CTA is to download a
      course if they fill out the lead form. The Contact link will be small and in the footer. No social media.
